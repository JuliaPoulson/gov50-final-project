## Project thoughts

I am interested in exploring data related to the midterm election in an effort to determine the relationship between election indicators (gdp, inflation, presidential approval, etc) and election results. I am working through the HPR Tech team on a midterm election prediction model, and I am hoping to use the data acquired through that project to look at relationships between multiple factors and election results for the final project in this course.
